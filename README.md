# CNN Image Classifiers

This repository contains code for the various CNNs I applied to classify Breast Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology images for my final year capstone research project.

This project was aimed at identifying malignant and benign FNAC lesions in breast tissues. 
The study was conducted for samples in two stains H&E and Giemsa and for images take at two resolutions 10x and 40x.
